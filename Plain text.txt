Thus it was that I gave up a mangificent career as a painter at the age of six. 
I had been disappointed by the lack of success of my drawing No. 1 and my drawing 
No. 2. Grownâ€“ups never understand anything by themselves and it is rather tedious 
for children to have to explain things to them time and again. So i had to choose 
another job and I learnt to pilot aeroplanes. I flew more or less all over the world. 
And indeed geography has been extremely useful to me. I am able to distinguish 
between China and Arizona at a glance. It is extremely helpful if one gets lost in the night.
